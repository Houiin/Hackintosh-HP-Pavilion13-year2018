# Hackintosh For HP  Pavilion 13 (i5-8265u)

## Known issues
After the opencore boot is completed, the screen may be black for about a minute before the screen lights up.

At this time, the screen is actually displayed, but the screen backlight does not light up. If you use a bright light on the screen, you can see what the screen is showing (lock screen or  your desktop).

Sometimes this problem may not be encountered.

Intel Wi-Fi and Bluethooth not work properly on macOS 12 Monterey

** Recommend use macOS 11 Big Sur at this time **
